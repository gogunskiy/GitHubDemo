What is missing:

1. Error handling
2. Tests (added one just for an example)
3. Loader on the details screen


What can be imporoved:
1. NetworkAgent is doing too much, need to move parsing on one level above
2. No logic to clear a list when we remove the search string
3. Loader is missing while we searching
4. Throtling time can be changed (it is just a constant, set it to 1 just for demonstration purposes)
5. There are some Force unwraps for URL. No time to fix :).
